  <p>Imagine, you have two variables and you don't know what they contain but need to check if they refer to the same object or not. How would you do that?</p> 
  <p>Write a function <code class="java">check(obj1, obj2)</code> that will take two objects and print <code class="java">True</code> if they refer to the same object and <code class="java">False</code> otherwise.</p>
